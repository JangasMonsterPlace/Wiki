# Trello
we are using Trello as a ticket manger (lol). There is currently just a single Board: [https://trello.com/b/M48OLhvy/gcp](https://trello.com/b/M48OLhvy/gcp)

## Stages
- **Stories**: Do not move tickets from here to another stage. Stories describes our big goals and they include checkboxes with links to their subtickets
- **Backlog / ToDo**: These are all tickets where currently nobody is working at
- **W2C**: Wait to continue - if a ticket started, but not finished and you do not continue working at it, put it into this column
- **Is Blocked By**: If you already started working at a ticket and it's blocked by another ticket, put it into this Column
- **In Progress**: Tickets which are in Progress. Assign yourself to the ticket if you are currently working at it. Make sure that you have not more than 2 Tickets in Progress
- **R4R**: Ready for Review. If a ticket is done (includes all subtasks) this column is used. We will walk through that column together each friday
- **Done**: if a ticket is completely done.

## Ticket Rules
- Ticket should have a description
	- Put Link to Story in the first place of the description
	- If the ticket blocks other tickets, make a list with links to the tickets which are blocked by this ticket
	- If the ticket is blocked by other tickets, make a list with links to the tickets which are blocking this ticket
- Add a new ticket always into the checklist of the story where it's belongs to
